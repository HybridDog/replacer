## Crust Mode

### Left click:
The replacer changes visually adjacent nodes (of the same type) on a surface 

Before is depicted above and after is below.


### Right click:
The replacer places nodes onto the surface so that the surface below it is hidden; the added crust can be bounded by other solid nodes but not translucent nodes.
